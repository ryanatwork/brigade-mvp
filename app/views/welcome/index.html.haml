  ADOPT-A-HYDRANT

%p Built for Boston, this map based web app lets individuals and groups assist firefighters by claiming responsibility for shoveling out hydrants during winter snowstorms.
%p Written to function as a platform, the app can been re-purposed for any kind of civic infrastructure. Because it&#8217;s open source, it can be improved by a community of practice. In Chicago,  the app&#8217;s capabilities were extended to include regions in addition to points. This led to <a title="City of Chicago site for Chicago Shovels" href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/mayor/snowportal/chicagoshovels.html" target="_blank">Chicago Shovels</a>, an app for adopting sidewalks.
